                <p class="lede">Notes recovered from an on‑call week when the pager wouldn't stop and the goats started to make a lot of sense.</p>

            <div class="note">
                Language and sarcasm ahead. This is satire—written by an exhausted techie who briefly imagined swapping <em>32‑bit cores</em> for <em>billy goats</em>.
            </div>

            <ul class="reasons">
                <li>You don’t have to monitor utilization on a goat.</li>
                <li>Milk a goat and it stays milked—for a while.</li>
                <li>There are no 32‑bit goats.</li>
                <li>No demos. If you ever do one, the goat just… works.</li>
                <li>When a goat goes down, you bury it and buy another.</li>
                <li>Left alone, billys and nannies do their jobs—no formatting, tracing or register inspection required.</li>
                <li>Nobody cares if you’re not a Certified Goat Engineer.</li>
                <li>Goat → steak is a one‑way state transition.</li>
                <li>People will take a fence‑painting tip from a farmer faster than from a computer weenie.</li>
                <li>No one can pad a résumé with fake goat experience.</li>
                <li>Goats don’t page you.</li>
                <li>When it comes to “software” (food), everything is compatible with goats.</li>
                <li>No “Goat 98” upgrade to fix “Goat 95.”</li>
                <li>You can tell whether a goat has been debugged by looking at it.</li>
                <li>Goats don’t go obsolete. If they do—and you didn’t neuter them—they self‑upgrade.</li>
                <li>No commute.</li>
                <li>Goats are cute. Computers aren’t (unless they’re Macintoshes, and those are just annoying).</li>
                <li>No dress code. Ever.</li>
                <li>You always have the right file permissions to milk your goat.</li>
                <li>Too many timeouts? Slow performance? That’s dinner.</li>
                <li>No “shareware dot com” for milking tools. You either have a bucket or you don’t.</li>
                <li>The bucket leaks or it doesn’t. No networks, ownership checks or checksums required.</li>
                <li>No “freeing up megs” before you milk.</li>
                <li>You get callouses—the way God intended.</li>
                <li>No staff meetings to standardize goat‑milking procedure.</li>
                <li>Nanny goats ship with zero TCP/IP and still deliver milk.</li>
                <li>Most barnyard animals are fault‑tolerant (some cows excluded).</li>
                <li>No weekend sign‑ins, badge swipes, or corporate coffee. If the pot’s burning, you yell at your spouse.</li>
                <li>No risk you’ve been milking an improperly labeled “development goat.”</li>
                <li>No preferred vendors. Context is always correct. No passwords. No intruder‑detection locks.</li>
                <li>Carpal tunnel is guaranteed. Don’t worry about it.</li>
                <li>Goats ship with all patches they’ll ever need. Otherwise: steak.</li>
                <li>Full goats do automatic core dumps, self‑reset and return online. You just clean up. No defrag, no compression, no Goat‑32.</li>
                <li>Unless the barn’s on fire, goats don’t care about power surges.</li>
                <li>No nightly backups.</li>
                <li>Every goat part shares the same interrupt and it still works.</li>
                <li>A goat is a goat is a goat.</li>
                <li>You never restart a goat. You do shut them down (first step in many recipes).</li>
                <li>No one needs a goat‑milking requirements document.</li>
                <li>You deliver applications to goats; not the other way round.</li>
                <li>Goats will do almost anything to get comfortable. Computers will loop an error forever, no matter how hard you smack the monitor.</li>
                <li>No logoff jingle while the “Exit Goat” animation plays.</li>
                <li>Your phone bill won’t reveal you over‑milked your goat.</li>
                <li>On a goat, <code>SYS$ERR.LOG</code> is always empty.</li>
                <li>Operating systems come and go; goats won’t be orphaned anytime soon.</li>
                <li>No workstation licensing.</li>
                <li>No one minds if you milk during business hours, or reformat a goat.</li>
                <li>Late shift? You’ll still see your kids—and probably recruit them to help.</li>
                <li>You don’t need 32 MB of RAM to start milking.</li>
                <li>Security is a stake and a rope.</li>
                <li>No one ever got a General Protection Fault milking.</li>
                <li>Ethernet and token‑ring goats can share a stable without a global lockup.</li>
                <li>You don’t have to name goats. If you do, duplicates don’t break anything.</li>
                <li>Your kids won’t meet weirdos online while playing with a goat.</li>
                <li>No antitrust battle over goat‑milking buckets. No “Make this my default bucket.”</li>
                <li>No desire for higher clock speed—and none available.</li>
                <li>No grounding straps or anti‑static bags… unless you’re making steak.</li>
                <li>There aren’t many ways to improperly shut down a goat.</li>
                <li>A room of younger farmers won’t make you feel old for talking 300‑baud or 4.7 MHz goats.</li>
                <li>Y2K.</li>
                <li>Uninstalling a goat doesn’t require software. Maybe a gun or a knife.</li>
                <li>Once the bucket is full, a goat can crash and you still won’t lose your work. Just don’t spill.</li>
                <li>New goats don’t rewrite farm registry keys that upset the chickens.</li>
                <li>No easter eggs in goats.</li>
                <li>Your spouse will never yell at you for removing the RAM from her goat.</li>
                <li>No Goat 2000, Goat Perfect 8 or Goat 123 to learn.</li>
                <li>No Internal IPX Address to boot a goat.</li>
                <li>No per‑bucket licensing.</li>
                <li>You’ll never spend four hours upgrading a goat over the wire.</li>
                <li>There is no Goat Ops.</li>
                <li>Goats follow upgrade procedures.</li>
                <li>Goats eat org charts.</li>
                <li>If a goat gets an uncleanable virus, you shoot it.</li>
                <li>If the virus is non‑terminal, the goat… handles it.</li>
                <li>No pagers; no “please advise.”</li>
                <li>Goats don’t care whether it’s Calcomp.</li>
                <li>No one cares about remote access to the herd.</li>
                <li>No MHN goat herd.</li>
                <li>No one cares if the goats aren’t talking to each other.</li>
                <li>Ever heard of a proprietary goat?</li>
                <li>No goat analysis meetings. No goat control meetings. No meetings.</li>
                <li>Goats will never need Service Pack 4.</li>
                <li>No DS problems at GOATADRIVE.</li>
                <li class="nsfw">You <em>work</em> the goat; the goat doesn’t work you—or your whole department.</li>
                <li>A goat might bite you, but it won’t… you get the idea.</li>
                <li>Forget Y2K.</li>
                <li>Goats don’t ask stupid questions.</li>
                <li>Goats don’t drain tech budgets that could have gone to cars.</li>
                <li>If a goat dumps in the night, you clean it up when you feel like it.</li>
                <li>No one fires you for connecting diskless goats to a goat server instead of buying a mainframe goat for dumb goats.</li>
                <li>ISO won’t publish a standard for your herd.</li>
                <li>Counting from zero and hexadecimal don’t apply (and look silly in a barn).</li>
                <li>When you sell a goat, there’s no export format for legacy goat readers.</li>
                <li>Everything still works at 100 goats, 256 goats—even 65,536 goats… probably.</li>
                <li>Party small talk rarely involves “I just got a French Alpine, how do I milk it?”</li>
                <li>No one can rummage through your goat and get you fired.</li>

                <li>You don’t need goats on your desktop—or shortcuts to goats. Most farmers don’t have desktops.</li>
                <li>Nothing in farming requires a mouse. If you have mice, you get a cat.</li>
                <li>Error messages are simple: Goat not found. Goat dead. Goat asleep. Too soon after last milking. Billy detected.</li>

                <li>Goats don’t need to know the time to work.</li>
                <li>Non‑Y2K‑compliant goats simply think it isn’t Y2K. No docs required.</li>

                <li>Goats don’t have enough fingers for <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>.</li>
                <li>Blame games don’t last; goats just kick each other’s asses.</li>
                <li>If goats documented every time they pooped, we’d be out of forests.</li>
                <li>Goats don’t care about email.</li>
                <li>The only “application delivery” a goat offers is… through the back end.</li>
